0.4
----
  * The RPXNow.api_version= can be set globally
  * Most methods now support :api_version=>'123', so you can specify the api_version on each call
	* Added support for unobtrusive code generation. This will make the gem play nicely with developers creating unobtrusive pages with frameworks such as jQuery;
	* The RPXNOW JSON responses are now parsed by Florian Frank JSON gem (http://json.rubyforge.org/);
	* Removed the dependency of ActiveSupport. However, if present, ActiveSupport will be used due to its convenience methods Array#to_query and Hash#to_query.
	* Added support for multiple versions of the widget. By default, everything will point to version 2;
	* The specs have been updated.

0.3
----
	* RPXNow::ServerError will be thrown when something is invalid/goes wrong, so watch out (not for invalid tokens in user_data)...
