  * The RPXNow.api_version= can be set globally
  * Most methods now support :api_version=>'123', so you can specify the api_version on each call

	* The RPXNOW JSON responses are now parsed by Florian Frank JSON gem (http://json.rubyforge.org/);
	* Removed the dependency of ActiveSupport. However, if present, ActiveSupport will be used due to its convenience methods Array#to_query and Hash#to_query.
